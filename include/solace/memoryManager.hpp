 * An interface for platform's virtual memory manager.
 * An object of this class is to be used for all operations that require memory allocation.
 * The purpose of this interface is to make memory allocation explicit.
 * This enables a fine control over when memory allocation is allowed. For instance for an application to
 * respect the "Power of 10" rules - memory allocation only allowed during initialization phase.
 * Once initialized application should not allocate memory. This class allows for such implimentations.
